# 1.) I have if I counted right 23 knots
2.)There is two major choices, one at the beginning and one at the end
3.) There is a loop at the end and a time passing a little before
4.) The choises players make will matter how it proceeds
5.) The player is allowed to change the state of the game with keys and wont let them pass door unless they have them.
6.) Again if I counted correctly i should have about around 23+ passages
